                <span class="modal-description">A whole questioning forum for gaming.<br><br>Languages used : HTML/CSS/JavaScript for the front-end, Go for the back-end and MySQL for the database.
                    <br><br>Starting as a school project to make a forum, we, with the help of two of my friends got the idea to link our passions together and centered it around gaming.
                    Through the details and the time we put into that work, we were selected with two other groups to make our forums official. We finally decided against it to allow us to focus on our own work.
                    <br><br>We allow people to create an account securely, make posts, comment on others posts, and vote on them. There are account management features, and a login system.
                    With the follow features, users can follow other users and see their posts. There is also a search feature that allows users to search for posts by title, content, or user.
                    Each user has a profile page that displays their posts, comments, and votes, as well as a biography, profile pictures and links of their choice.
                    <br>Moderation is an important matter for this forum, that's why we have made a moderation system that includes many roles such as moderators (can delete posts/comments),
                    admins (same as moderators but can also banner users), and banned users (can't post or comment, will have their profile pictures and bio deleted).

                    <br><br>As soon as the holidays started, I decided to take time to train myself on languages other than the one I was learning at school. Since I'm interested in the software development world,
                    I decided to make a calculator app in the languages I am trying to deepen my knowledge in, C#. Calculators being a base project in this field, I decided to make my own, and try the pink aesthetic to change from the grey usual one.
                    <br>In this app, you can find the basic operators (+, -, /, *, √), delete previous entry, clear all entries, and the equals button. The small screen will display the inputted number and the result.
                    There is a responsive design allowing the user to use the app on any screen.
                    I am planning to add more features to the calculator, such as the ability to use scientific notation, and the ability to use different bases.

                <span class="modal-description">A RPG 3rd person game involving detectives and gangsters in the 50s.<br><br>Languages used : C++, Blueprints, UE4.
                    <br><br>This game was created as a school project for the "Ydays" (a class where people from different degrees are put in a team together to create a project of their choice).
                    Our project director came up with the concept of a fox character named Mathew Clever, a charismatic detective and Daniel Leight a discreet ferret. Their goal is to investigate the districts of the mafia, and discover the truth about the Dappled Shadow.
                    <br>Together, we worked on it for a year and were able to include many features. We made a whole complete level, the player wake up in the town center and needed to find the clues hidden around the place.
                    Those clues were collectables that unlocked a portal to the next level if the player got them all. We also put enemies around the map. Those IA had guns and were able to shot and kill the player once his life reached 0.
                    To defend himself the player also had a gun and could attack and kill enemies. And thankfully, a checkbox displayed as a bar allowed the player to save game :)<br>Working with video games 3D students, we were able to have many designs and animations for the town and characters. They allowed me to learn many things about game making.
                    <br>In the most recent update of the game we worked on the next level with the boss fight, items drop, quest board, NPC talk, make Daniel Leight a playable character and weapon switch.
                    <br>The year being done, I'm proud of the result and the work we've done. I'm planning on working on similar projects for the incoming year to improve the knowledge I learned in this class.

                    <br><br>During my holidays, I decided to take some time to continue to improve the knowledge I learnt thanks to the CLever and the Dapple Shadow project.
                    To achieve this, I decided to make many usual features that we can find in FPS/RPG game. I will also be able to use those features in future projects saving me lot of time.
                    <br>As of today, we can find the following features : slide on the ground, items drop. And I'm currently working on weapon switch , weapon spread, weapon reload, NPC talk, sound effects, map + mini-map, abilities, and collect items manually and automatically.
                    <br>Not being specialized in game programming and game making in my studies, this is a real challenge for me to learn. Being truly interested in the field of game development, I believe this is a good way to expand my skills and knowledge.

                    <br><br>This website was developed as a school project. The goal was to understand how to use APIs. With coworker, we decided to use the twitch API to get the information we wanted.
                    The twitch API is free to use but is also a bit tricky. Indeed, the security system behind it can be a bit difficult to understand for beginners. That's why we took the challenge to make a website that uses this system.
                    <br>In this website, we can find a list of chosen streamers on the main page and every single streamer's with the search bar. You can choose how they are going to be filtered to get the one you are looking for more easily.
                    <br>Each streamer as a page where you can see if they are currently streaming, their emotes, their followers amount, their name, their description, the date of creation of their accounts, ... and much other information that can be given by the API.

                    <br>The game is pretty simple to use, you just have to react with your keyboard when asked. Loving the concept of the game, I am currently working on making a 2D version of the game using Unity and C#.

                    We decided to make a website about the Game Genshin Impact since it's a game we both loved.
                    <br>On this site we can find game news, and a list of characters, information about them and their game builds. Since this was our first big project using the language, there are still many things we can improve. But we are still happy and proud of the work we gave on this.
                    <br>We are thinking of doing a rework of the website using an API/database we would make ourselves and reworking on some design elements.
